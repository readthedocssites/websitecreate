Backup Strategies
===============

This guide covers best practices for backing up your Trezor wallet and recovery seed.

Recovery Seed Backup
------------------

Your recovery seed is the master key to all your crypto assets. Proper backup is essential.

Paper Backup
^^^^^^^^^^

The basic method using the recovery cards included with your Trezor:

1. Write down your recovery seed words in order
2. Store in a secure, dry location
3. Consider making multiple copies stored in different locations

.. warning::
   Paper is vulnerable to fire, water damage, and fading over time. Consider more durable options for long-term storage.

Metal Backup Solutions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Metal backups provide superior durability:

1. **Stamped metal plates**: Use letter stamps to mark your seed words on metal plates
2. **Punched metal cards**: Punch holes or marks to represent your seed words
3. **Engraved metal**: Have your seed words professionally engraved

Commercial options include:

* Cryptosteel
* Billfodl
* Coldbit
* CRYPTOTAG

Seed Phrase Security
------------------

Storage Locations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consider these secure storage options:

* Home safe
* Bank safety deposit box
* Hidden location in your home
* Split storage (different words in different locations)

Risks to Avoid
^^^^^^^^^^^

Never store your seed in these ways:

* Digital photos
* Text files or documents
* Email or cloud storage
* Password managers

Advanced Backup Strategies
------------------------

Shamir Backup
^^^^^^^^^^^

Available on some Trezor models, Shamir Backup splits your seed into multiple shares:

1. Create 3-16 recovery shares
2. Set a threshold of how many shares are needed for recovery (e.g., 3 of 5)
3. Distribute shares to trusted people or locations

This provides security through redundancy - no single share can compromise your funds.

Multi-Location Strategy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For high-value holdings:

1. Create primary backup using metal storage
2. Store a second backup in a different physical location
3. Consider giving a backup to a trusted family member or attorney

Testing Your Backup
-----------------

Regular verification is crucial:

1. Schedule regular checks (every 6-12 months)
2. Verify all words are legible
3. Check that storage conditions remain secure
4. Consider doing a practice recovery (with small amounts) to ensure you understand the process

Inheritance Planning
-----------------

Ensure your loved ones can access your crypto assets if something happens to you:

1. Include cryptocurrency instructions in your will
2. Create a detailed guide with recovery instructions
3. Consider using a dead man's switch service
4. Consult with an attorney familiar with cryptocurrency

.. note::
   Never include the actual recovery seed in your will or legal documents. Instead, provide instructions on where to find it.

Recovery Seed Hygiene
-------------------

To maintain the security of your backup:

1. Never enter your seed into any website or software
2. Only enter your seed into your hardware wallet during recovery
3. Be wary of any situation requiring you to reveal your seed
4. If you suspect your seed might be compromised, transfer funds to a new wallet immediately
