Setting Up Your Trezor
=====================

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up your Trezor hardware wallet.

Initial Setup
-----------

When you first connect your Trezor device to your computer, you'll need to complete the following steps:

Create a New Wallet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If this is your first time using a Trezor or you want to create a new wallet:

1. Connect your Trezor to your computer
2. Open Trezor Suite
3. Select "Create new wallet"
4. Follow the on-screen instructions

Recover an Existing Wallet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you already have a recovery seed from a previous wallet:

1. Connect your Trezor to your computer
2. Open Trezor Suite
3. Select "Recover wallet"
4. Enter your recovery seed words when prompted
5. Follow the on-screen instructions

Setting Up PIN Protection
-----------------------

Your PIN is the first line of defense for your Trezor device:

1. When prompted, look at your Trezor screen for the PIN layout
2. The numbers will be shown in a randomized order on your Trezor device
3. Use the on-screen keypad in Trezor Suite to enter your PIN
4. Confirm your PIN by entering it a second time

.. note::
   The PIN layout is randomized and shown only on your Trezor device to protect against keyloggers and screen recording malware.

Creating and Storing Your Recovery Seed
-------------------------------------

Your recovery seed is the most important security element of your Trezor:

1. Trezor will display 12 or 24 words (depending on your model)
2. Write down each word carefully on the recovery seed cards provided
3. Double-check each word after writing it down
4. Verify your recovery seed when prompted

.. warning::
   Never take a photo of your recovery seed or store it digitally. Never enter your seed on a keyboard unless you're recovering your wallet.

Storage Recommendations:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Store your recovery seed in a secure location
* Consider using a metal backup solution for fire and water resistance
* Keep backup copies in different secure locations
* Never share your seed with anyone

Advanced Setup Features
---------------------

Hidden Wallets (Passphrases)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For additional security, you can create hidden wallets with passphrases:

1. In Trezor Suite, go to Settings > Device
2. Enable Passphrase protection
3. When connecting your device, you'll be prompted to enter a passphrase
4. Different passphrases create different wallets with separate accounts

.. note::
   If you forget your passphrase, there is no way to recover your funds. Make sure to securely store any passphrases you use.

Multiple Accounts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can create multiple accounts within your wallet:

1. In Trezor Suite, click on "Add account"
2. Name your new account
3. Use different accounts for different purposes (e.g., savings, daily spending)
