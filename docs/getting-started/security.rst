Security Best Practices
=====================

Protecting your cryptocurrency assets requires following security best practices.

Essential Security Rules
----------------------

1. **Keep your recovery seed offline**
   
   Never store your recovery seed on a computer, phone, or cloud storage. Always write it down on paper or store it on metal backup plates.

2. **Verify recipient addresses**
   
   Always double-check addresses on your Trezor device screen before confirming transactions.

3. **Use a strong PIN**
   
   Set a PIN that is at least 6 digits long and not easy to guess (avoid birth dates, sequential numbers, etc.).

4. **Keep your firmware updated**
   
   Regularly check for and install firmware updates to ensure you have the latest security features.

5. **Beware of phishing**
   
   Only download Trezor software from the official website (trezor.io) and check the website's SSL certificate.

Physical Security
---------------

Protecting Your Device
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Store your Trezor in a secure location when not in use
* Consider using a safe or lockbox for long-term storage
* Keep your device away from extreme temperatures and moisture
* Be cautious about who knows you own a hardware wallet

Protecting Your Recovery Seed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Use a metal backup solution for fire and water resistance
* Consider splitting your seed into multiple parts stored in different locations
* Never leave your recovery seed cards in plain sight
* Consider using the Shamir Backup feature (if available for your model)

Digital Security
--------------

Safe Computing Practices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Use a dedicated computer for cryptocurrency transactions if possible
* Keep your operating system and antivirus software updated
* Use a secure, password-protected Wi-Fi connection
* Enable two-factor authentication for all related accounts (email, exchanges, etc.)

Avoiding Common Attacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Clipboard attacks**: Always verify addresses on your device, as malware can swap addresses in your clipboard
* **Phishing**: Check URLs carefully and bookmark the official Trezor website
* **Social engineering**: Be suspicious of unsolicited help or contact from "support"
* **Screen monitoring**: Shield your screen when entering sensitive information

Advanced Security Measures
------------------------

Using Passphrases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Passphrases add an extra layer of security:

* Create hidden wallets with different passphrases
* Use strong, memorable passphrases
* Consider storing emergency funds in a passphrase-protected wallet

Multi-signature Setups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For high-value holdings:

* Consider setting up multi-signature wallets requiring multiple devices to authorize transactions
* Distribute keys across different people or locations
* Document the setup securely for recovery purposes

Regular Security Checks
---------------------

Establish a routine to:

1. Check your device for physical tampering
2. Update firmware and software
3. Verify your recovery seed is still secure and readable
4. Review transaction history for unauthorized activity
